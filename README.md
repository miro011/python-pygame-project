# The Cursed Forest

### COMP 4555 Games Development Final Project FALL 2022

## Details
- **Title:** The Cursed Forest
- **Pitch:** Do you have what it takes to escape the cursed forest?
- **Genre:** 2D platformer / shooter
- **Audience:** Gamers seeking a challenge
- **Engine:** Pygame
- **Run the game:** launch the run.py file with python
- **Creator:** Miroslav Nikolov

## Description:
- The player has wandered into a cursed forest and is surrounded by demonic creatures.
- Luckily, he has brought his drone with him, equipped with a special weapon, capable of erasing the demonic creatures.
- Unfortunately there are too many of them, so the player needs to escape as soon as possible.
- For that to happen, he needs to run 10 miles to the right, where his car is parked.
- Will he make it? It's up to you!

## Mechanics
- **Go backwards**
  - Enemies spawn on the right side of the screen a lot more often
  - Going backwards may allow the player to regain control
- **Shoot**
  - Can pierce multiple enemies
  - Slow projectile speed - anticipation required
  - Bullet will only go as far as where the cursor was when fired
  -  Can't shoot until previous bullet is finished
- **Jump, sprint, slow down**
  - Allow you to dodge enemies
- **Crosses**
  - Kill all enemies when picked up

## Mechanics justification
- In the absence of these mechanics the game would not be beatable
- If the limitations are removed or toned down, the game would be too easy and not fun
- That is why, to make the game fun and engaging, the balance aims to force the player to use all mechanics simultaneously in order to be successful

## Uniqueness
- This game is almost entirely original. The only aspect taken from others is the forest setting.
- The reason why it's unique is because it was completely unplanned for and random.
- My initial vision for the game had nothing to do with the result.
- In fact, the idea for the game changed quite a few times as I was making it, then changed again while balancing it.
- Even though there are plenty of games where you need to dodge and shoot at the same time, I doubt there is one with a drone over the character's head and the combination of mechanics I use.
